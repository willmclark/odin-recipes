        <ol>
            <li>Rinse your quinoa well in a mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>Add the quinoa to a small saucepan, along with 1 cup of water, 1 veggie bouillon cube, and a pinch of sea salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and cook for 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the broccoli, cover again, and cook for 3 more minutes. Check the quinoa. If there is still water in the pan cook for 5 more minutes or until the water is absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl. Add a Braggs Liquid Aminos and extra virgin olive oil to taste. Prepare for another Twin Peaks marathon, and enjoy!
